# Trance Choir
**Concepts behind the *Trance Choir* project by Ultra Voye.**

---

## A. Introduction

*Trance Choir* is a project of introspection for DJs — an open question about how they relate to the Mystery. A gesture of adoration through euro-trance music <small><sup>[Note 1]</sup></small>.

DJs usually perform before a thirsty crowd, expecting them to pump the party [1]. Ultra Voye wonders whether DJs also need a break — a space of their own to speak inwardly, and to find God within their music.

Seek the Mystery, speak to It and play for God. Go on retreat, grind your soul and lift it up.

**God, too, is thirsty.**
