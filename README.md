# Trance Choir
**Concepts behind the *Trance Choir* project by Ultra Voye.**
Work in progress

## A. Introduction

*Trance Choir* is a project of introspection for DJs — an open question about how they relate to the Mystery. A gesture of adoration through euro-trance music <small><sup>[Note 1]</sup></small>.

DJs usually perform before a thirsty crowd, expecting them to pump the party [1]. Ultra Voye wonders whether DJs also need a break — a space of their own to speak inwardly, and to find God within their music.

Seek the Mystery, speak to It and play for God. Go on retreat, grind your soul and lift it up.

**God, too, is thirsty.**

## B. Concept

**From personal experience to materiality**

### Experience

**ACT I: POV. First exposure to BCM and euro-trance**

It’s December 2024. I’ve been having a rough few months. It’s night-time, and we’re heading to a club near Gran Vía. Young, joyful people gather by the entrance. I’m with [@jorgeselfother](https://github.com/jorgeselfother). 

We’re going to BCM V [3]. Just a few hours ago, I didn’t even know who Baby Pantera was [4]. We walk down the stairs. It’s the first turn of the set.

What is this music? It’s beautiful, it’s violent. The beats are frenetic, overwhelming. It’s condensed euphoria. It’s euro-trance.

Months later, after countless hours on SoundCloud playlists, I realized that this had been the sound of my own purgatory — the redemption of Ultra Voye. Music for the demons of the desert to speak. Music for the God in my heart to forgive.
